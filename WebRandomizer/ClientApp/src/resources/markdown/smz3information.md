# Randomizer Information

## What is this randomizer

The Super Metroid and A Link to the Past Crossover Randomizer is an item
randomizer that combines Super Metroid and A Link to the Past into one
experience and shuffles all the items and spreads them out in random locations
in any of the games.

Travel between the games is possible through the use of four cross-game portals
spread out in the games in certain doors and entrances.

The game starts out in Super Metroid right after Samus' ship has landed on
Zebes, and from this point there's the option to head further down into Super
Metroid, or head to the first available cross-game portal. This portal is found
in the door that normally would head to the Crateria Map Station, but this will
instead take you outside the fortune teller's house south of Link's house in
Hyrule.

These are the four cross-game portals in the game:
* Lake Hylia Fortune Teller ⇔ Crateria Map Room
* Back of Old Man Cave ⇔ Norfair Map Room
* Dark World Ice Rod Right ⇔ Maridia Missile Refill
* Misery Mire Right Shed ⇔ Golden Torizo Energy Refill

The goal is to defeat both Mother Brain in Super Metroid and Ganon in A Link to
the Past, and after defeating the second final boss it is possible to end the
game and reach the credits. After defeating the first final boss you will still
retain access to the game where you killed the boss, in case there are some
items left to be found to complete the other game.

A new concept of "Boss Tokens" has been introduced to count as a kill credit for
entering Tourian in Super Metroid.

Crystals, Pendants and Boss Tokens are shuffled fully between both games.
This means that killing a Super Metroid boss can for example reward a Crystal
or a Pendant, and a Link to the Past boss can reward a SM Boss Token.
You can check what boss prize you will get by checking the in-game map in both
games. In Super Metroid the prize icon is shown below the boss location.

Being familiar with the regular [A Link to the Past Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/)
and [Super Metroid Randomizer](https://sm.samus.link/) is a great benefit for
playing this randomizer.

## Quick guide to getting started

To create a new randomized game, head over to the [Generate Randomizer Game](/configure) page.

1. Select the options you want to use for the game, and then press **Generate
   Game** to generate a new game.
2. After doing so you will be redirected to the "permalink" page where you need
   to select your original Super Metroid and A Link to the Past (Japanese 1.0)
   ROM's to continue.
3. There are also a few extra customization settings that can be done here such
   as changing the sprites of Samus and Link as well as some other options.
4. When you're happy with the options, hit *Download ROM* and you'll get a new
   ROM that you can play with an emulator or SD2SNES.

If you didn't select the *Race ROM* option, there will also be a *Playthrough*
section that will list the items and their locations in case you get stuck and
need some hints.

## Game generation options

These options are available when generating a new game.

### Super Metroid Logic

This option selects what kind of logic to use for item placement inside Super Metroid.

* Normal - Normal logic includes only what Super Metroid teaches players itself.
  Anything that's not demonstrated in-game or by the intro cutscenes will not
  be required here. Required moves include for example:

    * Wall jumping (not including very precise ones)
    * Shinesparks in any direction (short charging for these is not expected)
    * Infinite Bomb Jumps

* Hard - Hard logic is based upon the "no major glitches" ruleset and includes
  most tricks that are considered minor glitches, with some restrictions.
  You'll want to be somewhat of a Super Metroid veteran for this logic.
  Required moves include (in addition to anything in Normal logic) for example:

    * Mockballs
    * Short charging
    * Suitless underwater navigation
    * Continuous wall jumps
    * Forced heat damage
    * Advanced damage boosting
    * Clipping through certain blocks using enemies
    * and more...

### Goal

This option decides what goal is required to finish the randomizer.

* Defeat Ganon and Mother Brain - Find the required crystals and boss tokens kill both bosses.

* Fast Ganon and Defeat Mother Brain - The hole to ganon is open without having to defeat
  Agahnim in Ganon's Tower and Ganon can be defeat as soon you have the required crystals to
  make Ganon vulnerable. For keysanity, this mode also removes the Crateria Boss Key requirement
  from Tourian to allow faster access.

* All Dungeons and Defeat Mother Brain - Similar to "Defeat Ganon and Mother Brain", but also
  requires all dungeons to be beaten including Castle Tower and Agahnim.

### Open Ganon's Tower

The amount of crystals required to be able to enter Ganon's Tower.
If this is set to Random, the amount can be found in-game on a sign next to Ganon's Tower.

### Ganon Vulnerable

The amount of crystals required to be able to harm Ganon.
If this is set to Random, the amount can be found in-game on a sign near the top of the Pyramid.

### Open Tourian

The amount of boss tokens required to enter Tourian.
If this is set to Random, the amount can be found in-game on a sign above the door leading to
the Tourian entrance.

### First Sword

This option decides where the first sword will be placed.

* Randomized - The sword can be placed anywhere.
* Early - The sword will be placed in a location accessible from the start of the game.
* Uncle assured - The sword will always be placed on Link's Uncle.

### Morph Ball

This option decides where the morph ball will be placed.

* Randomized - The morph ball can be placed anywhere.
* Early - The morph ball will be placed in a location accessible from the start of the game.
* Original location - The morph ball will always be placed at its original location.

### Key Shuffle

This option decides how dungeon items such as keys are shuffled.

* None - A Link to the Past dungeon items can only be placed inside the dungeon
  they belong to, and there are no changes to Super Metroid.
* Keysanity
    * Maps, Small Keys and Big Keys can now be found anywhere in either game.
    * There are now new Keycard items for Super Metroid that unlocks new types of doors.
    * Three different levels of keycards exists:
      * Level 1 - Lets you open all the doors with a matching Level 1 marker
        above it for the specified area.
      * Level 2 - Lets you open all the doors with a matching Level 2 marker
        above it for the specified area.
      * Boss - Opens the door to the boss for the specified area (The crateria
        Boss Keycard opens both Bomb Torizo and the Golden 4 Statue room).
    * Each area in Super Metroid has either 2 (Wrecked Ship and Lower Norfair)
      or 3 keycards that can be found.
    * Markers showing the locked doors and their keycard type in Super Metroid
      have been added to the in-game map.
    * There is also a tracker showing what Keycards you have found overlaid in
      the bottom right of the in-game map screen in Super Metroid.
    * A Link to the Past Compasses have been removed from the item pool to make
      space for the Super Metroid Keycards.

### Seed

If you want to enter a custom number to be used as the random seed you can do
so here, or leave it blank to have a random one picked for you. Numbers between
0 and 2147483647 are valid.

### Race ROM

Enabling the Race ROM option will generate your game without access to any spoiler log.

### Game Mode

Picks the game mode you want:

* Single player - Regular single player game.
* Multiworld - Creates a co-op multiplayer multiworld session and requires
  additional entry of player count and player names.

## Customization Options

These options are entered after game generation and are cosmetic or non
gameplay-altering options only.

### Play as

This lets you select the sprite to use for Link and Samus.

For Samus there is a toggle for how you want the Screw Attack animation to look
when you don't have Space Jump equipped. If it is unchecked, the Screw Attack
animation will always include the Space Jump animation as well (as in the
original game), but if it's checked you will get the Screw Attack animation
applied on top of the regular spin jump animation.

### Heart Beep

Sets the speed of the heart beep sound in A Link to the Past.

### Heart Color

Changes the color of the hearts in the HUD for A Link to the Past.

### Energy Beep
